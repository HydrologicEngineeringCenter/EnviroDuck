ENVIRO_DUCK

The ENVIRO_DUCK program was developed by the Vicksburg District with assistance from wildlife biologists from the FWS.  The program was developed to provide the hydrology data required to run the FWS caloric model for ducks.  The model uses daily stages, stage-area curves, the beginning and ending dates for the annual waterfowl season, the maximum feeding depth, the percent land-use of available forage foods, and the caloric value of the available forage foods.  With this information, it calculates the daily acres flooded and the daily kilocalories of forage food available.  The FWS model provides the kilocalories required per day for ducks.  The model then calculates the duck-use-days (DUD) of available habitat (the number of ducks that can be supported each day by the available habitat).  The daily DUD are summed for the period of record and divided by the total days in the waterfowl seasons for the period of record to determine the average DUD provided in the project area.  The procedure is repeated for each project alternative to determine the change in habitat available due to the various project alternatives.
